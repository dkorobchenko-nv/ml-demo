# Classical Machine Learning Demo

## Iris

**Iris dataset analysis and classification**

Jupyter notebook with tasks: `task/iris.ipynb`

Same notebook with all tasks solved: `solved/iris.ipynb`

## MNIST

**MNIST dataset analysis and classification**

Jupyter notebook with tasks: `task/mnist.ipynb`

Same notebook with all tasks solved: `solved/mnist.ipynb`

## Prerequisites

*Most probably other versions of the packages will work too, but here is the exact tested configuration*

* Python 3.6
* numpy==1.15.3
* scikit-learn==0.20.0
* scikit-image==0.14.0
* imageio==2.4.1
* matplotlib==3.0.1
* jupyter==1.0.0
* tensorflow==1.11 (or tensorflow-gpu==1.11)
    * just for MNIST data loader, you may use other sources
